Bloodborne is my favourite video game of all time. Being an avid gamer, Bloodborne was a brilliant experience, an ARPG set in a Lovecraftian deliciously gothic scene there where the world is filled with twisted monsters and you as a hunter must challenge the most difficult of enemies and bossfights overcoming all the odds. I therefore downloaded some data on the bosses within the games and created my own dashboard to reflect my love for games and data analysis and created a small report here that reflects that.

The attached Power BI report shows a search bar you can search certain data for in return for a feedback table from the dataset there is a graph showing Health Points against boss, and aside in the Pie Chart shows how much Blood Echos, the in game currency you get for each of the bosses on a first run and the percentage of that makeup of the total proportion that they share!
